# SoftwareDevelopment-CA
The objective of this project was to develop a software application that can receive user input, process the data, and present the results in a user-friendly manner.
The focal point of this project was centered around a hotel. The user was provided with a menu containing six options, each corresponding to a specific action. 
Option 1 allowed the user to add one to five hotels along with their respective locations and ratings. Option 2 displayed all the information that had been previously added. 
Option 3 enabled the user to search for hotels based on a specific rating, displaying any matches found. Option 4 calculated and presented the average rating of all the hotels. 
Option 5 showcased the hotel with the highest rating. Lastly, option 6 allowed the user to exit the program.
